HyattReview=I can't say anything about the rooms. They were nice, clean and they even let me do a really early check-in without any additional cost. There was an issue with the wifi, but it wasn't a big deal What changes my mind was the owful treatment received by the bold morning frontdesk guy. I booked through Expedia and needed the invoice to expense the hotel back to my company. I did it in Argentina and Miami many times, and no one said it was impossible... I asked they lady in the frontdesk, but she told me to talk with her manager (the bold guy). He refused in a bit aggressive manner to give me the invoice, saying that it was impossible for him due to some price privacy policy between them and Expedia (which for me as a customer are not an issue). I asked a few times again, till I asked him to talk with his manager. Uncredibly he replies "I don't have a manager", so then I ask "Ah, so you are the owner of this place", to what his answers: "yes, I am". I could not believe the response, what a crappy and disrespectful person. At least as a customer yo expect a respectful treatment and someone willing to help, not someone that creates more problem.That's how you build customer preference. I have to stay for like 4 months in Miami, so they lost a chance to catch a customer for this period due to this guy attitude, I can't say anything about the rooms.
