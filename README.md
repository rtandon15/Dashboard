Implementing Automation on any Web Based Application using Selenium is no more a challenge now !!
Just extend this Framework by including it in your build path & leverage the reusable components which would help developing Automated Test Scripts for your application very easy and much faster...

Framework Features:
- Itâ€™s a Generalized, Platform independent, Scalable and Extensible framework for automated testing of Web Applications. 
- The Framework has been built up using open source tools Selenium WebDriver, Selenium Grid, ReportNG, TestNG, Maven & Jenkins.
- Supports Parallel execution of Tests on Multiple Browsers and Multiple Machines that reduces execution time.
- Automated Re-run of failed Scripts.
- ActionMethods Library with a set of 100+ reusable actions which cant be directly performed using Selenium.
- Easily Integrable with Jenkins to support CI and Scheduled runs
- HTML reports with failure Screenshots.
- Grouping of Test Scenarios and selective execution.
- Uses open source tools.
- Dynamic object locators (eg. clickAndWait(ResourceCenterPage.Filter_Option.format("Client Stories"),2);)
- Implements standard Data driven and Keyword Driven approaches in Automation.
- Implements Page Object Model 
- Platform Independent. ( Windows, Mac OSx, Linux)
- Supports AJAX based Web applications.
- Multiple browser support. (Firefox, IE, Chrome, Opera, Safari)

Usage:
- Clone the project in Eclipse
- Create pages specific to your application in "pages" package in main and define objects and page specific methods in it.
- Create factory methods for each page in PageFactory class in global package. eg included
- Define Test Data in BaseData class in data package
- Write your tests in tests package in test by referring to the sample Tests included. While writing tests, Reuse the existing 100+ set of re-usable actions with java-docs defined in ActionMethods class. This actions have implicit reporting implemented for failures. 
- Configure testng.xml with the test groups to run and parallel thread count
- Configure test.properties with the browser, server.. on which to run the tests
- Start the Selenium stand alone server using command > java -jar selenium-server-standalone*.jar
- Run the tests by right click > Run As > TestNG Suite option on testng.xml
- Check the Test Reports by opening test-output/html/index.html folder
